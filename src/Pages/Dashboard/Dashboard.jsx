              1.1.2 one for logged in user 

            1.2 not logged in interface
              1.2.0 Write a big ERROR sign with red just like in source games
              1.2.1 will have the message: You must be logged in before uploading your own custom files
              1.2.2 will need to be either toggled on on top as a layer(You need to implement security to this one, it can be toggled off)
