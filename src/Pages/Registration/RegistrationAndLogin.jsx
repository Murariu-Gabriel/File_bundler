  //          PLAN

  // big pointer - I want to make login and register get swapped with an animation 

  // the transition in between them should possible from both sides


  //    Login

  // - will be made to check user on click and let backend do the job

 
  //    Register

  // you need to decide what inputs you will have
  // for now it will be full name | email | password | repeat password
  
  // ? question: will some of the validation be made on frontend? It seems tedious for the user to not have some directors 


  // All the password requirements will need to be listed somewhere so the user knows how to write it
